Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?
I think this assignment was hard but fun. Naming the variables were
Super annoying but everything was fun. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?
This assignment helps me understand the usage of gdb and datatype design
well, but it has too many redundant work and the ratio of time spent
on this assignment over the output of this assignment is too high.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?
N/A

What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

Splint 3.1.2 --- 20 Aug 2022
nodeDTGood.c: (in function Node_new)
nodeDTGood.c:148:48: Variable ulIndex used before definition
  An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some execution
  path. (Use -usedef to inhibit warning)
nodeDTGood.c: (in function Node_free)
nodeDTGood.c:180:35: Variable ulIndex used before definition
dtGood.c: (in function DT_traversePath)
dtGood.c:94:42: Variable ulChildID used before definition
path.h:94:13: Function exported but not used outside path: Path_getComponent
  A declaration is exported, but not used outside this module. Declaration can
  use static qualifier. (Use -exportlocal to inhibit warning)
   path.c:316:1: Definition of Path_getComponent
Finished checking --- 4 code warnings

The style errors generated by splint occur in the provided code, not our written code.

What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

Checking checkerDT.c

   checkerDT.c: line 152: low priority:
   This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

   checkerDT.c: line 158: low priority:

We can ignore nested loop warnings according to the assignment instructions

What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

None

What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no

Checking nodeFT.c
   nodeFT.c: line 61: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'poNResult' through an assert?
   nodeFT.c: line 61: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?
   nodeFT.c: line 337: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?

poNResult may be NULL since we are going to set it to be the new node
in the function. pvContents may be NULL because files can have
empty contents, and directories always have no contents. pvNewContents
may also be NULL since we are allowed to replace initial contents to
NULL (removing contents of a file).

Checking ft.c
   ft.c: line 664: low priority:
   A file should contain no more than 15 functions;
   this file contains 17 functions
   ft.c: line 257: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?
   ft.c: line 462: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?
   ft.c: line 663: low priority:
   A source code file should contain fewer than 500 lines;
   this file contains 664 lines

We can ignore the too many functions warning and too many lines warning
according to the assignment instructions. pvContents may be NULL since
files can have empty contents, and directories always have no contents.
pvNewContents may also be NULL since we are allowed to replace initial
contents to NULL (removing contents of a file).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.
      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1       BDT_insert 
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2       BDT_freeSubtree  
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3       BDT_addChild
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4       BDT_strlenAccumulate

         ./bdtBad5       BDT_findNode 
===============================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?


In dtgood.c, variables bad naming convention in DT_preOrderTraversal.
In nodeDTgood.c, Node_compare function should be a static helper
function since it is not used elsewhere; in line 168, DynArray_new(0)
means "start with minimum capacity" but that's not obvious. A named
constant like INITIAL_CHILDREN_CAPACITY would be clearer; for Node_new
function, it not only creates a new node but also linked the child into
the parent's children array. If the linking fails after the node is
created, it will be hard to clean up the memory. It will be better to
have Node_new just create the node and have a separate function handle
parent-child linking
